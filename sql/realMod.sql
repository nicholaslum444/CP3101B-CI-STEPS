('IS5126',7,'Hands-On With Business Analytics','Business Analytics is the growing, inter-disciplinary field of bringing data to build business insights and support decisions. The goal of the course is to bridge the divide between technical skills and business know-how. Through learning-by-doing, students will engage in a series of business case study discussions, guided group projects, and a final semester project of their own design. Lectures will cover practical skills using the latest tools and techniques, as well as discuss business cases and applications. The module will give students practice in the data funnel from gathering and collecting data, extraction-transformation-loading, analysis, and interpretation. Applications will cover areas such as retailing, customer relationship management (CRM), social media, and marketing.',54,'yyyyyyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyy-yyyyyyyyyyyy'),
('CS3217',7,'Software Engineering on Modern Application Platforms','Students will learn about the essential Software Engineering (SE) principles and develop their SE skills by writing mobile apps for the iOS platform. During the second half of the semester, students will work in teams of not more than 4 students to develop cool and innovative iOS apps. Students can pretty much develop whatever apps that they desire as long as it is not immoral and does not compromise learning values. Visit our FaceBook page on https://www.facebook.com/cs3217 to find out more about the apps that were created by past students from CS3217.',41,'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'),
('CS3218',7,'Multimodal Processing in Mobile Platforms','Modern mobile platforms such as smart phones and tablets are equipped with an increasing number of sensing modalities. In addition to traditional components such as keyboards and touch screens, they are also equipped with cameras, microphones, inertial sensor, and GPS receivers. With these modalities all packed into a single platform, it is important to empower application developers with basic knowledge and practical skills in dealing with these modalities. This module introduces the students to basic theories, concept and practical skills needed in input, processing and output of multimodal data on mobile platforms.', 18,'qqqqqqqq-qqqq-qqqq-qqqq-qqqqqqqqqqqq'),
('CS3240',7,'Interaction Design','CS3240 Interaction Design is intended for students in computing and related disciplines whose work focuses on human-computer interaction issues in the design of computer systems. The course stresses the importance of user-centered design and usability in the development of computer applications and systems. Students are taken through the analysis, design, development, and evaluation of human-computer interaction methods for computer systems. They acquire hands-on design skills through laboratory exercises and assignments. The course covers HCI design principles and emphasizes the importance of contextual, organizational, and social factors in interaction design.',52,'pppppppp-pppp-pppp-pppp-pppppppppppp'),
('CS3247',7,'Game Development','The objective of CS3247 Game Development module is to introduce techniques for electronic game design and programming. This module covers a range of important topics including 3D maths, game physics, game AI, sound, as well as user interface for computer games. Furthermore, it will give an overview of computer game design, publishing and marketting to the students. Through laboratory projects, the students will have hands-on programming experience with popular game engines and will develop basic games using those engine. Module Theme: Design to Market. Expected Outcome: After completing the course students will be able to create Games Independently (Indie Game Developers - individual or a small team) as well as work in a team of large Game projects/studios.',50,'oooooooo-oooo-oooo-oooo-oooooooooooo'),
('CS3284',7,'Media Technology Project II','This module is the second part of a two-part series on the development of media technology systems such as interactive systems, games, retrieval systems, multimedia computing applications, etc. Students will form project teams to work on media technology projects. This second part focuses on the development of algorithms required for the systems, implementation and testing of the algorithms and the systems, and evaluation of the systems according to the users requirements.',	45,'tttttttt-tttt-tttt-tttt-tttttttttttt'),
('CS4244',7,'Knowledge-Based Systems','This is a module that contains both the theory and practice of building knowledge-based systems. The aim of this module is to prepare students so that they can design and build knowledge-based systems to solve real-world problems. The module starts with motivations, background and history of knowledge-based system development. The main content has five parts: rule-based programming language, uncertainty management, knowledge-based systems design, development and life cycle, efficiency in rule-based language and knowledge-based systems design examples.',18,'rrrrrrrr-rrrr-rrrr-rrrr-rrrrrrrrrrrr'),
('CS4344',7,'Networked and Mobile Gaming','This module aims at providing students with a deep understanding of various technical issues pertaining to the development of networked games and mobile games. Students will be exposed to concepts from distributed system, operating systems, security and cryptography, networking and embedded systems. In particular, issues such as game server architectures (mirrored, centralized, peer-to-peer etc.), consistency management (bucket synchronization, dead reckoning etc.), interest management, scalability to large number of clients, cheat prevention and detection, and power management will be discussed.',35,'kkkkkkkk-kkkk-kkkk-kkkk-kkkkkkkkkkkk'),
('CP3101B',7,'Web programming and Applications','This module is offered as part of the CP3101 Topics in Computing series. It introduces software development on the web. Topics include networking, clients and servers, HTTP protocol and HTML5 localStorage, HTML5 forms, CSS, dynamically served pages using PHP, DOM, Object Oriented Javascript and jQuery, and combining Javascript and PHP to build an AJAX web application. We will also investigate the use of Javascript, HTML5 canvas, sensor API and mobile platform to build responsive mobile. Some advanced topics may be discussed such as web security and how to generate traffic to your web application.',58,'zzzzzzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzz-zzzzzzzzzzzz');
